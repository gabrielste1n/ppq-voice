# PPQ Voice

PPQ Voice is a lightweight Electron desktop app that turns any text field into a dictation box. Press a single hotkey, speak, and the app streams your audio directly to Groq’s hosted Whisper endpoint. The finished text is automatically cleaned up by Groq’s Llama/Mixtral models and pasted wherever your cursor was. No local models, no Python installs—just reliable cloud transcription with a tidy UI.

## Why Teams Use PPQ Voice

- **Cloud-first dictation** – Streams audio to Groq’s Whisper API for fast, consistent transcriptions.
- **Automatic paste + history** – Captured text is pasted into the active app and stored locally in SQLite.
- **AI clean-up pipeline** – Groq reasoning models (Llama 3.1 + Mixtral) tidy punctuation, lists, and formatting automatically.
- **Cross-platform** – macOS, Windows, and Linux packages powered by Electron + Vite.
- **Ops-friendly** – Toggle `PPQVOICE_DEBUG=true` to write rich logs to the user data directory.
- **Zero local-model overhead** – No llama.cpp builds, Python dependencies, or multi-GB downloads.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HeroTools/ppq-voice.git
cd ppq-voice
npm install
cp env.example .env   # add your PPQ (Groq) API key
npm run dev           # launches Vite + Electron with hot reload
```

Want the production build? Run `npm start` to launch Electron with the prebuilt renderer bundle.

## Configuration

### `.env` keys

| Key | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PPQ_API_KEY` | ✅ | The Groq key used for Whisper transcription and Llama/Mixtral clean-up. |
| `PPQVOICE_GROQ_BASE_URL` | optional | Override the Groq base URL (defaults to `https://api.groq.com/openai/v1`; HTTPS or localhost only). |
| `PPQVOICE_DEBUG` | optional | `true` writes detailed logs to `~/Library/Application Support/ppq-voice/logs` (platform-specific equivalents). |

All other preferences (language, reasoning model, hotkeys, API fallbacks) can be changed inside the Control Panel UI. They persist in `localStorage` and synchronize with the renderer.

## NPM Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Runs Vite + Electron with live reload. |
| `npm start` | Launches Electron in production mode (expects a built renderer). |
| `npm run build` | Builds the renderer and packages the desktop app for the current OS. |
| `npm run pack` | Prepares an unsigned directory build (great for quick installs). |
| `npm run lint` | Runs ESLint on the renderer source (`src/`). |
| `npm run clean` | Sweeps `dist/`, `src/dist/`, and resets the dev SQLite DB. |

## Building Installers

```bash
npm run pack                # unsigned build (all platforms)
npm run build:mac           # macOS DMG/ZIP
npm run build:win           # Windows NSIS + portable
npm run build:linux         # Linux AppImage + deb
```

Artifacts land in `dist/`. On macOS the unsigned app lives at `dist/mac-arm64/PPQ Voice.app`; Windows gets `dist/win-unpacked/PPQ Voice.exe`.

## Permissions You’ll Need

PPQ Voice needs two macOS permissions (Windows/Linux equivalents are requested automatically):

1. **Microphone** – required for recording audio.
2. **Accessibility** – needed so the app can paste transcriptions for you.

You can revisit both in **Control Panel → Settings → Permissions** if something stops working. The onboarding wizard also walks through granting them.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| “PPQ key not found” | Confirm `.env` + Control Panel → PPQ Cloud has a valid value. |
| Nothing pastes after transcription | Re-request Accessibility permission from Settings, then relaunch the app. |
| Need extra logs | Run `PPQVOICE_DEBUG=true npm start` (or `npm run dev -- --debug`). Logs go to `%APPDATA%/ppq-voice/logs`, `~/Library/Application Support/ppq-voice/logs`, or `~/.config/ppq-voice/logs`. |
| Updater stuck | Use Control Panel → Settings → Updates → “Download Update” to retry, or grab the latest release from GitHub. |
